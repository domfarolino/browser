  // NOTE ABOUT THREAD SAFETY:
  //   * The below |event_count_| can be modified from any thread that interacts
  //     with |this| loop, and therefore its writes are guarded by |mutex_| so
  //     that all writes persist.
  //   * The below |events_| is only ever written to and read from the thread
  //     that |this| loop is bound to, in the Run() method.
  //   * Reading from these variables does not need to be synchronized. In
  //     Run(), we read from |event_count_| to resize |events_|. You can imagine
  //     that once we read |event_count_| to resize |events_| (for submission to
  //     `kevent64()`), we're only taking a snapshot of the value. It could have
  //     changed by the time we _actually_ call `kevent64()` to wait for events,
  //     to either greater or less than the one we snapshotted. Let's consider
  //     each case separately.
  //       1.) Value was increased after snapshot:
  //           For example, we enter the loop in Run() with |event_count_| set
  //           to 4 (three socket readers + our wakeup event). We resize
  //           |events_| accordingly, but before we call `kevent64()` to wait
  //           for at most 4 events, two more readers are added, and the actual
  //           value of |event_count_| gets updated to 6 and the underlying
  //           kernel queue knows about 6 possible event sources. We call
  //           `kevent64()` with the argument `num_events=4`, meaning we'll
  //           return with at 4 events ready to process from the 6 event
  //           sources. This is totally valid! The kqueue system actually lets
  //           you process a single event at a time with num_events=1 if you
  //           want, it's just less efficient.
  //       2.) Value was decreased after snapshot:
  //           Similar to the above example, we invoke `kevent64()` with
  //           `num_events=x` even though the number of event sources that the
  //           underlying kernel queue actually knows about is x-2, for example.
  //           In this case, the number of events we are willing to accept is
  //           larger than the number of events the kernel queue will ever
  //           produce, which is also fine. You can try setting |event_count_|
  //           to an absurdly high number below and running the tests.
  // END NOTE
  // The number of event types (filters) that we're interested in listening to
  // via |kqueue_|. There is always at least 1, for the |wakeup_| port (or
  // |port_set_|), but increase this count whenever we register a new e.g.,
  // |SocketReader|.
